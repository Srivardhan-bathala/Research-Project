Ultrasound is an important diagnostic imaging tool, commonly used in healthcare for the evaluation of internal body structures. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has become a significant research subject in medical imaging and diagnostic radiology. CAD is widely applied in the detection and differential diagnosis of various abnormalities in medical images obtained through different imaging modalities.
Computer-aided diagnostics involve two key elements: detection and diagnosis. Detection is the technology used to locate the organ, while diagnosis means identifying the disease.
This project aims to detect the median nerve in ultrasound images of the wrist.
The dataset was provided by the Medical Imaging Group (MIG) at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, during my internship.
