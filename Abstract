Ultrasound is an important diagnostic imaging tool, commonly used in healthcare for the evaluation of internal body structures. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has become a significant research subject in medical imaging and diagnostic radiology. CAD is widely applied in the detection and differential diagnosis of various abnormalities in medical images obtained through different imaging modalities [1].
Computer-aided diagnostics involve two key elements: detection and diagnosis. Detection is the technology used to locate the organ, while diagnosis means identifying the disease [2].
This project aims to detect the median nerve in ultrasound images of the wrist.
